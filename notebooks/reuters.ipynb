That provision was later broadened by the\\n  subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.\\n      Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still\\n  collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.\\n      Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed\\n  until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill\\n  and 0/92.\\n      The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program\\n  follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential\\n  farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,\\n  and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.\\n      Congressional sources said there has not been enough time\\n  to study the implications of a broad 0/92.\\n      \"The timing (of the proposal) is off,\" said one aide to a\\n  House Agriculture committee member.\\n      However, several Congressional sources said they expect a\\n  broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House\\n  Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make\\n  spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part\\n  of an overall deficit reduction package.\\n      Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley\\n  (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture\\'s share of budget cuts may\\n  exceed one billion dlrs.\\n      A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the\\n  Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration\\n  estimate it would result in significant budget savings.\\n      A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all\\n  1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5\\n  billion dlrs over five years.\\n      Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the\\n  approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.\\n      Some officials said it already is late for implementation\\n  of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for\\n  wheat and feedgrains.\\n      If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either\\n  would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

But economists said that\\n  seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\\n  economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\\n  after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\\n      U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\\n  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\\n  mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\\n  1986.\\n      The rate at which permits were issued for future building\\n  climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\\n  mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\\n      \"February\\'s weather is usually more adverse for home\\n  building. Because of seasonal factors it\\'s difficult to\\n  determine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\\n  Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\\n      The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\\n  weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\\n  inflate the statistics.\\n      Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\\n  building last month. But several believe that rates will now\\n  consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\\n      \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\\n  \\'Let\\'s do it now\\',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\\n  Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\\n  of the financing for home building.\\n      But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\\n  potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \\n  some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\\n      He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\\n  summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\\n  November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\\n      As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\\n  the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\\n  typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\\n  vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\\n  following tax law changes effective January 1.\\n      Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\\n  mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\\n      \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\\n  mortgage rates are doing their job. But we\\'re probably not\\n  looking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\\n  McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\\n      McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\\n  larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\\n  output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\\n  to start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\\n  Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\\n      But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\\n  come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\\n  convinced that growth will pick up in future.\\n      \"The big story is the inventory re-building that\\'s going on\\n  now, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\\n  U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\\n  produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\\n  compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\\n      Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\\n  quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\\n  growth in the second, he said.\\n      \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\\n  and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\\n  there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\\n  agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating\\n  first quarter GNP prospects.\\n      Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that\\n  current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.\\n      \"At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the\\n  first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the\\n  second,\" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei\\n  Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Some 80 pct of\\n  Japan\\'s LPG imports are from the Middle East.\\n      Saudi Arabia\\'s state owned oil company Petromin has made\\n  some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the\\n  recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the\\n  Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.\\n      The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been\\n  unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to\\n  replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.\\n      Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by\\n  Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87\\n  pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)\\n  of Arabian Light.\\n      Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings\\n  should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian\\n  Light\\'s GSP.\\n      Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the\\n  95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,\\n  the trade sources said.\\n      Petromin also suggested that a seller\\'s option of supplying\\n  up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to\\n  seller-buyer agreement.\\n      Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut\\n  supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.\\n      \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable\\n  basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" said\\n  an official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher for\\n  cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a\\n  longer haul and war risk insurance payments.\"\\n      Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to\\n  finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on\\n  contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to\\n  current levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, we\\n  would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of\\n  high dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The Wednesday\\n  average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.\\n      Lending further support to the stable policy view was a\\n  relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the\\n  latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in\\n  the banking system, economists said.\\n      \"For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,\\n  with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,\" said Darwin Beck of\\n  First Boston Corp. \"I expect it to continue in that vein.\"\\n      \"Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion\\n  dlrs,\" added First Chicago\\'s Johnson.

Pentagon officials said the platform had\\n  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the\\n  lower Gulf.\\n      \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown\\n  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting\\n  capabilities,\" Cordesman said.\\n      He predicted the United States would respond to any future\\n  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran\\'s naval base at Bandar\\n  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the\\n  approaches to Iran\\'s oil export terminal on Kharg Island.\\n      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the\\n  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, \"but\\n  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action\\n  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.\" \\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Senior EC financial expert in\\n  Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\n      \"You have to look at the dollar\\'s peak compared with now,\\n  and that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\\n      On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\n  263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\n  242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\n  periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\n  dollar trend has been down, down, down.\\n      Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\n  rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\n  European currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\n      The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\n  flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\n  undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\n  changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\n  both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\n  This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\n      Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\n  of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\n      Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\n  pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\n  and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\n      \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\n  tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\n  sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\n  to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\n  laying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\\n      The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\n  in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\n  start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\n      The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\n  U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\n  imbalance, and which will cause problems.\\n      \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\n  reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\n  therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\n  edge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\n  Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\\n  my objective view, I don\\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\\n  trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\\n  and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\\n   REUTER...\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\\n  convert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\\n      But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\\n  impossible to calculate.\\n      They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\\'s\\n  economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\\n      \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\\n  achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\\n  contributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\\n      The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\\n  Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\\n  for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\\n  martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\\n  originally devised several years ago by the Institute of\\n  National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\\n  commission.\\n      According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\\n  economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\\n  trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\\n  credits from Western commercial and government lenders.\\n      But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\\n  booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\\n  the estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\\n  which has no real scientific evaluation.\"\\n      A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\\n  the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\\n  annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\\n  imposed.\\n      Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\\n  200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\\n  surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\\n  against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\\n      Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\\n  U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\\n  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\\n  dried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\\n  accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\\n  political reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\\'s an illusion based on a\\n  misunderstanding of Western economy.\"\\n      \"There\\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\\n  who has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\\n  Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\\n  in the 1970s which were no longer today\\'s reality.\\n      Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\\n  diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\\n  and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\\n  scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\\n  lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\\n  on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\\n  and lacks the means to modernise its industry.\\n      \"MFN doesn\\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will not\\n  be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\\n  regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\\n  in play now,\" said one Western envoy.\\n      He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\\n  quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\\n  measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\\n  Poland\\'s efforts to regain entry.\\n      Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\\n  this fact recently.\\n      Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\\n  up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\\n  difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\\n  two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\\n  exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\\n      While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\\n  has a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\\n  imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\\n  \"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\\n  of the Polish economy won\\'t cut any ice. The Americans will\\n  just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\\n  Solidarity.\"\\n      Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\\n  talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\\n  Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\\n  looking for a lead from the United States.\\n      He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\\n  financial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short\\n  time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\\n  foreign economic partners.\"\\n      He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to\\n  play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\\'s partners\\n  interested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"\\n      Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\\n  Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\\n  Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\\n  said it should now play a more positive role.\\n      \"As a major superpower the United States can influence\\n  international organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings\\n  aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\\n  which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to\\n  be 14.7 mln bpd this week.\\n      Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend\\n  oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.\\n      \"This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000\\n  bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,\\n  the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting\\n  it to be there,\" McKinley said.\\n      International oil traders said that other short-haul\\n  crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian\\n  refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily\\n  available Mideast crudes earlier this week.\\n      If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up\\n  the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading\\n  managers at several companies told Reuters.\\n      But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long\\n  OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.\\n      Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity\\n  Management, said OPEC production was lower \"because of the\\n  Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it\\n  gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\"\\n       He added, \"The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other\\n  members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the\\n  Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low\\n  as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price,\" he added.\\n      There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the\\n  spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.\\n      Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery\\n  into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which\\n  traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of\\n  18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.\\n      Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far\\n  East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.\\n      \"There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government\\n  deals, which are below official prices and this is probably\\n  being resold,\" one international trader said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

This winter, however,\\n  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\\n  so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\\n  due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\\n      \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There\\'s a good correlation\\n  between mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said.\\n      Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\\n  in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\\n  entire winter crop area, she said.\\n      Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\\n  snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \\n  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\\n  forecaster for Accu Weather, said.\\n      Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\\n  fall and winter, analysts said.

       "  b'ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE\\n  Quarter-point prime rate increases to\\n  7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be\\n  followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of\\n  the Federal Reserve\\'s policy intentions, economists said.\\n      \"Based on the spread between banks\\' cost of funds and the\\n  prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but\\n  no rush is likely,\" said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.\\n      Citibank\\'s surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by\\n  Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.\\n      McCulley said that once the spread between three-month\\n  certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than\\n  1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime\\n  rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.\\n      However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they\\n  see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near\\n  term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to\\n  follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,\\n  the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks\\n  lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount\\n  rate increase in April of that year.\\n      Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since\\n  last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct\\n  shortly after the Fed\\'s half-point discount rate cut to the\\n  current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.\\n      \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There\\n  should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2\\n  pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.\\n  Lanston and Co.\\n      Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today\\'s\\n  meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may\\n  well foster higher interest rates soon.\\n      Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy\\n  change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate\\n  pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat\\n  up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.\\n      \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to\\n  tighten policy when they did today\\'s coupon pass,\" said Joseph\\n  Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.\\n      In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the\\n  Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by\\n  offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for\\n  its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\"\\n      \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy\\n  change,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter\\n  Reynolds Inc. \\n      She said the spread between banks\\' cost of funds and the\\n  prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153\\n  basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not\\n  really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate\\n  increase.\\n      The Dean Witter economist said that today\\'s prime rate rise\\n  \"may have been less a response to interest rates than an\\n  attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\"\\n      Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to\\n  developing countries, large money center banks with heavy\\n  exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in\\n  an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.\\n      The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money\\n  to one another could help determine how many banks match the\\n  higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.\\n      In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of\\n  funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal\\n  funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly\\n  6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  \\n      The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting\\n  demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the\\n  close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five\\n  and 6-3/4 pct.\\n      Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds\\n  rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the\\n  6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,\\n  banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.\\n      But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many\\n  that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to\\n  help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Money market sources said the market had begun\\n  to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\\n  to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\\n      But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\\n      There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\\n  Exchequer Nigel Lawson\\'s forecast of a 1987 current account\\n  deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\\n      Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\\n  February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\\n      Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\\n      However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\\n  Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\\n  prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\\n  Chancellor\\'s Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\\n  on imported goods.\\n      However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\\n  his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\\n  forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\\n  stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\\n      He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\\n  confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\\n  Confederation of British Industry.\\n      The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\\n  January\\'s bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\\n  goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\\n  Harwood said.\\n      U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\\n  point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\\n  about the figures evaporated.\\n      Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\\n  to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\\n  than the European low of 1.5960.\\n      However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\\n  sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\\n      Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\\n  largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\\n  Conservative government\\'s support was slipping.\\n      The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\\n  support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\\n  Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\\n  pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\\n  whose own support fell from 38 pct.\\n      The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\\n  enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\\n  the voters indifferent, political observers said.\\n      Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\\n  that today\\'s improved sentiment could be dented if support for\\n  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\\n      This upsetting of the markets\\' political perceptions, which\\n  are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\\n  general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\\n  Harwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\\n  relief,\" he said.\\n      However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\\n  that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\\n  encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\\n  already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\\n  response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\\n  lower rates have been curtailed.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

If current policy remains in force,\\n  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last\\n  year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.\\n      The department said the President's budget proposals for\\n  1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24\\n  billion dlrs.\\n      In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain\\n  close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct\\n  average of 1980-86, it said.\\n      Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume\\n  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven\\n  years, the department said.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

It has\\n  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\\n  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\\n  wisdom of some of those moves.\\n      \"They\\'ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\\n  it\\'s largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\\n  financial analyst Simon Smithson.\\n      Among Sumitomo\\'s problems are limits placed on its move to\\n  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\\n  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\\n      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\\n  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\\n  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\\n  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\\n      \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\\n  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\\n      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\\n      \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\\n  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\\n  years, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\\n      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\\n  into the securities business at home.\\n      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\\'s\\n  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\\n  from investment banking.\\n      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\\n  said he hopes further deregulation will create new\\n  opportunities.\\n      \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\\n  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\\n  bank related. That\\'s the kind of deregulation we want.\"\\n      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\\n  domestic securities business as profitable government bond\\n  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\\n  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\\n      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\\n  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\\n  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\\n       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\\n  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\\n  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\\n  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\\n      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\\n  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\\n      \"We don\\'t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\\n  in two or three years,\" he said.\\n      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\\n  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\\n  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\\n      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\\n  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\\n  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\\n      \"It\\'s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\\n  Kleinwort\\'s Smithson.\\n      \"After that, it\\'s a question of absorbing and juggling\\n  around.

The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of\\n  the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival\\n  throughout May, it said.\\n      Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to\\n  350,000 tonnes, Oil World said.

So far this year only five\\n  exploratory wells have been drilled.\\n      \"I don\\'t think they\\'ll even get to what they did last\\n  year,\" Mitchell said.\\n      No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of\\n  the decade, Mitchell said.\\n      Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the\\n  number of producing wells and overall production.\\n      Between February and October of 1986, the number of\\n  producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from\\n  more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy\\n  Commission.\\n      In line with that decrease, California\\'s crude oil output\\n  fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is\\n  expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.\\n      Between February and October 1986, California\\'s crude oil\\n  production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels\\n  per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.\\n      Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986\\n  was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405\\n  mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of\\n  Conservation.\\n      \"Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,\"\\n  Guerard said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

This would leave a budget deficit\\n  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of\\n  GDP.\\n      The government, having consistently overshot its own\\n  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a\\n  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the\\n  budget, analysts said.\\n      \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"\\n  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.\\n      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less\\n  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using\\n  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the\\n  money and capital markets.\\n      South African Mutual\\'s Lee believes government spending\\n  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49\\n  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5\\n  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the\\n  IMF.\\n      \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted\\n  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away\\n  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past\\n  two years.\\n      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the\\n  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis\\n  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over\\n  loans to the country in September 1985.\\n      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling\\n  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,\\n  government officials say economic growth is the prime\\n  objective.\\n      But private-sector economists caution that the government\\'s\\n  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is\\n  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the\\n  current account of the country\\'s balance of payments.\\n      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5\\n  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the\\n  nation\\'s estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an\\n  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international\\n  creditor banks.\\n      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has\\n  little room to manoeuvre.\\n      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and\\n  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and\\n  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax\\n  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.\\n      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions\\n  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only\\n  election.

The institute had made the revision\\n  due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.\\n      A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil\\n  producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's\\n  fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.\\n      Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this\\n  year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private\\n  consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct\\n  in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.\\n      Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2\\n  pct last year due to the slack economic activity.\\n      Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit\\n  of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion\\n  surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's\\n  central bank, last month forecast the current account would be\\n  roughly in balance this year.\\n      However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have\\n  no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the\\n  budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9\\n  pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he\\n  said.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

Analysts noted that a\\n  general collapse in exploration and production volumes was\\n  partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln\\n  stg from 205 mln in 1985.\\n      Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected\\n  currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter\\n  results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding\\n  forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete\\n  Wedd noted.\\n      However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in\\n  performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the\\n  improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high\\n  refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.\\n      The impact of recovering oil prices would come through\\n  faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a\\n  high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which\\n  typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year\\n  lag, analysts said.\\n      Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third\\n  quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.\\n      Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in\\n  the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in\\n  U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\\n  had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\\n  added.\\n      Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\\n  U.S. Exploration activity. \"Exploration is currently pretty\\n  flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no\\n  massive upturn,\" he said.\\n      A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North\\n  Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.\\n      Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. \"If\\n  you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,\" he\\n  noted.\\n      U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day\\n  (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed\\n  below 20 dlrs a barrel.\\n      This favored OPEC\\'s attempts to stabilise prices, as the\\n  lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC\\n  marginal production shutting down. \"OPEC has done pretty\\n  extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,\"\\n  he added.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

It recommended that to stop friction\\n  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\\n  transformation in its traditional policies on economic\\n  management and the nation\\'s lifestyle. There can be no further\\n  development for Japan without this transformation.\"\\n      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\\n  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change.

In February, EC Industrial\\n  Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\\n  only know that your government, under the leadership of\\n  Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\\n  outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\\n  report which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\\n      And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\\n  answer than protectionism would be structural change within the\\n  Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report.

And while many manufacturing firms turned\\n  to financial market investments for profits during last year\\'s\\n  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to\\n  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.\\n      Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is\\n  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have\\n  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase\\n  inventories and step up capital spending, one government\\n  economist said.\\n      In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price\\n  drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices\\n  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a\\n  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,\\n  one central bank official said. \"That will at least take a\\n  couple of days, if not weeks,\" he said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

UAL last month said New York Real estate developer\\n  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also\\n  held discussions with its chairman.\\n      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the\\n  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.\\n      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying\\n  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2\\n  mln shares.\\n      \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think the\\n  pilot\\'s proposal is realistic. I don\\'t exptect them to take it,\\n  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL\\n  management,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.\\n      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack\\n  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz\\n  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a\\n  strategy to become a travel service company.\\n      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union\\n  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention\\n  on its airline.\\n      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its\\n  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.\\n      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has\\n  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100\\n  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as\\n  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe\\n  the stock is in play.\\n      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted\\n  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a\\n  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps\\n  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.\\n      \"The first domino is you have an investor with a\\n  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type\\n  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\"\\n  said Pettee.\\n      \"What\\'s interesting is the values are there.
